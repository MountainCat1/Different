Demo1_bed;This is your bed... Probably not the most comfy in the world... But for sure better than a floor.
Demo1_garbage_1;Some of your things... a little bit of garbage...
Demo1_garbage_2;You should clean this place some day.
Demo1_nightshelf_1;Your night shelf. There is some stuff inside... but nothing of importance.
Demo1_nightshelf_2;You find a key in a night shelf!
Demo1_nightshelf_3;Good thing you didn't forget it's there...
Demo1_table;Empty table in a middle of your room.
Demo1_DoorNeedKey1;Door seem to be locked.
Demo1_DoorNeedKey2;You are quite sure you did hide a key in your night shelf.
Demo1_poster1;Poster presents a solider with a rifle. It seems he is aiming at someone...
Demo1_poster2;Poster shows a view of lone mountain surrounded by plains... Kinda sad you never saw such thing with your own eyes...
Demo2_Shary_1;Ow... Hello! You finally awake!
Demo2_Shary_2;Hope you slept well…
Demo2_Shary_3;Do you need any more time?
Demo2_Shary_3_a;No. I am ready.
Demo2_Shary_3_a_1;That's good. Go get your stuff.
Demo2_Shary_3_a_1_a;Got it!
Demo2_Shary_3_a_1_b;What stuff?
Demo2_Shary_3_a_1_b_1;Your bag…
Demo2_Shary_3_a_1_b_2;You left it in a room in the south.
Demo2_Shary_3_b;I wanted to ask something
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1;What's on your mind?
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_a;What is happening?
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_a_1;The cops are sniffing around. We have to move to some other place…
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_a_2;It's probably because of some hidden cell of anarchists that was found nearby. 
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_a_3;Idiots… can't even hide well…
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_b;Where are we going?
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_b_1;I got info about someone who would be able to take us for some period of time.
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_b_2;I'm not sure of course about him, but it's better than staying here and waiting for cops to find us.
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_b_3;The info I got from my good old friend. He is trustworthy…
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_b_4;Even if not very intelligent…
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_b_5;Anyway… our first objective will be to meet him in person, then we will think of the rest.
Demo2_Shary_3_b_1_c;Nevermind
Demo2_Shary_3_c;I need to do something.
Demo2_Shary_3_c_1;Sure. Just please hurry up.
Demo3_bag1;You see your bag laying in a middle of the room. You packed all you would ever need inside it.
Demo3_bag2;You pick up your bag from the ground… It's quite heavy… But you made sure you can handle it when you were packing it.
Demo3_documents;You see documents laying all over the table. All of them boring as they can be.
Demo3_cup;You see a red cup on a table… You can guess it was filled with tea before someone drank it.
Demo3_chair;You see lone wooden chair next to a wall.
Demo3_poster_1;You see a poser of planet Earth on a wall. It gives you a feeling of…
Demo3_poster_2;…hope…
